PyLadies Logo Usage
===================

PyLadies and the PyLadies logo are trademarks of the Python Software Foundation.  The full trademark usage policy can be read here: :doc:`trademark`.

In general, we want the logo to be used as widely as possible to indicate the support of or involvement with PyLadies. If you are a local PyLadies leader, you are free to adapt the logo to your location.  However, non-leaders, please `ask`_ first when using a derived version of the logo or when in doubt.



Derivitive Work

If you are a local PyLadies leader, you are free to adapt the logo to the location.  Some examples are below, and more can be found on our `locations`_ page.
