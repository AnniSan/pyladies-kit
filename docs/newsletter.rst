Newsletter
==========

The Pyladies global newsletter is sent out as regularly as we can make it; all work is voluntary, and all information is volunteered! Everyone who subscribes via the email form on  http://pyladies.com will receive the newsletter.  



Contributing
++++++++++++
The editor of an upcoming issue of the PyLadies global newsletter might make an effort to gather info about all the chapters via a message to the organizers mailing list, but the onus is on each chapter's organizer(s) to send any updates about a chapter to the editor if they want to be included.


Editing
+++++++

If you'd like to volunteer to edit the next issue, all you have to do is shoot an email to the organizers mailing list! Warning: it's a lot of work!  We use Mailchimp.
