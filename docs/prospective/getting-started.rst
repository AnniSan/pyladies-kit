Getting Started
===============

So You’ve Decided to Start Your Own PyLadies Group
----------------------------------------------------

**YAY!** We’re excited to have people like you join our growing community and want to help you get your group launched as quickly and painlessly as possible. If our experience is any indication, your first major event will galvanize and inspire the Python community in your area and create momentum for subsequent events, so it’s crucial to start things off on the right foot!

To help you get started, we’ve created an open-source kit for starting your own PyLadies group in your city. PyLadies is part social club, part stepping stone toward the Python open-source world.


Things to Think About
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Types of Local Groups
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A local group can be:

#. a geographic group: for a city, region, state, or country
#. a student group: for a university, college, or school
#. an interest group: for any topic (e.g. PyGame, SciPy, Django)

The larger the local group, the harder it is to meet in person. Large local group's events will be mostly virtual meetups that occur online, whereas small local group's events tend to be in-person meetups.

A local group can consist of sub-local-groups, making both the in-person and virtual meetups possible.

Group Size
^^^^^^^^^^

It’s fine if your local group is small. Having just 2-3 women who meet regularly to exchange Python tips and tricks counts as a local group. What matters most is *quality*, not quantity.

Larger local groups have more flexibility to organize different types of events, but it’s harder to get everyone together for dinner.


Process of Starting a New PyLadies Location
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Everything is listed in :doc:`checklist`, but an overview of the process is:

1. Think about who you'd like to have help you, if you'd like.
2. Think about the name of the location.  For instance, do you want "PyLadies of Super Awesome City", or "Super Awesome City PyLadies", or "SACPyLadies"? We **highly** encourage to not choose a name that is the whole country or state, e.g. "PyLadies of California".  We do not want to discourage other women from starting a local PyLadies, say "PyLadies of Santa Barbara" when "PyLadies of California" is only focusing on the Bay Area.
3. Fill out the initial interest form (linked in the checklist).
4. If you haven't heard from anyone within a week, please `ping us`_!  Once you do, you will be given a PyLadies email address, which is also your Google Apps account.
5. Sign up for ALL the things with your new PyLadies email address, like Meetup.com, Twitter, Facebook, or anything that's relevant to your location.
6. If you have signed up for Meetup, you may request reimbursement of fees paid from the Python Software Foundation.  Check out their `grant process`_ for more information, as well as a :doc:`../organizer/grants/sample-meetup-proposal`.
7. Think about how you want to setup your website (e.g. a static HTML/CSS/JS site, or a dynamic site with Django/Flask/etc).  More information in :doc:`../organizer/neworganizer/website`
8. Fill out the PyLadies resource form with all the new accounts (linked in the checklist).
9. Start hosting events!
